🏨 Hotel Reservation Prediction: An End-to-End MLOps Pipeline

Predicting Customer Reservation Cancellations with Automated ML Deployment

This project demonstrates a robust, end-to-end MLOps pipeline for predicting whether a hotel customer will cancel their reservation. Leveraging a modular codebase, automated CI/CD, and cloud-native services, it showcases best practices in machine learning engineering and deployment.
🎯 Project Overview

In the competitive hospitality industry, predicting reservation cancellations is crucial for optimizing resource allocation and maximizing revenue. This project tackles this challenge by developing a machine learning model that predicts cancellation likelihood based on various booking features. More importantly, it establishes a complete MLOps workflow to ensure the model is continuously trained, validated, and deployed reliably and efficiently.

Key Objectives:

    Build a predictive model: Accurately forecast hotel reservation cancellations.

    Automate the ML lifecycle: Implement pipelines for data ingestion, transformation, model training, and deployment.

    Ensure reproducibility: Track experiments and manage model versions.

    Achieve continuous delivery: Deploy the model as a web service via CI/CD.

    Secure operations: Manage sensitive credentials and permissions effectively.

✨ Key MLOps Features & Practices

This project incorporates a wide array of MLOps principles and tools:

    ☁️ Data Ingestion from GCP Buckets: Automated fetching of raw reservation data directly from Google Cloud Storage buckets, ensuring a scalable and reliable data source.

    ⚙️ Modular Project Structure:

        src Directory: Organized into data_ingestion, transformation, model_training, and pipelines for clear separation of concerns.

        config Module: Centralized configuration management using a dedicated config.py for all parameters, paths, and settings, promoting maintainability and easy updates.

        OOP Concepts: Extensive use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with classes for data handling, model training, and pipeline stages, enhancing code reusability, testability, and scalability.

        Exception Handling: Robust error handling implemented across all pipeline stages to ensure graceful failure and provide clear debugging information.

        utils Module: Collection of helper functions to support various tasks, from data loading to logging.

        logging: used logging in python well

    📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Feature Engineering (FE): Initial data exploration and feature engineering were performed in Jupyter Notebooks to gain insights and prepare data for model training.

    🧪 Experiment Tracking with MLflow:

        MLflow is integrated to track all model training experiments, logging parameters, metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), and artifacts (trained models).

        Enables easy comparison of different model runs and selection of the best-performing model.

    🚀 Automated CI/CD with Jenkins & Google Cloud Run:

        Jenkins: Orchestrates the CI/CD pipeline, triggering builds, tests, and deployments upon code changes.

        Docker Containerization: The Flask web application, serving the inference API, is containerized using Docker.

        Google Cloud Artifact Registry: Docker images are built and pushed to Google Cloud Artifact Registry for secure and versioned storage.

        Google Cloud Run Deployment: The containerized application is automatically deployed to Google Cloud Run, providing a fully managed, scalable, and serverless environment for the inference service.

    🔒 Secure Credential Management: Utilized secret keys and GCP service account keys with fine-grained permissions to securely access Google Cloud resources, ensuring best practices for sensitive information.

    ✅ Pipeline Testing & Validation: Rigorous testing of all pipeline components (data ingestion, transformation, model training) to ensure correctness and reliability before deployment.

🏗️ Architecture

The project's architecture is designed for automation, scalability, and reliability:

    Data Source: Raw hotel reservation data resides in Google Cloud Storage Buckets.

    Code Repository: The entire codebase is hosted on GitHub.

    CI/CD Trigger: Any push to the main branch on GitHub triggers a build job in Jenkins.

    Jenkins Pipeline:

        Pulls the latest code from GitHub.

        Executes the MLOps pipelines (data_ingestion, transformation, model_training).

        Logs experiment details and artifacts to MLflow Tracking Server.

        Builds a Docker image for the Flask inference application.

        Pushes the Docker image to Google Cloud Artifact Registry.

        Deploys the new image to Google Cloud Run.

    Inference Service: The deployed Flask application on Google Cloud Run serves predictions via a REST API.

    Security: GCP Service Accounts and secret keys manage access and permissions throughout the pipeline and deployment.

🚧 Challenges & Solutions

Developing this end-to-end MLOps pipeline presented several interesting challenges, which were successfully overcome:

    GCP Permissions & Service Accounts: Initially, configuring the correct IAM roles and permissions for service accounts to interact with Cloud Storage, Artifact Registry, and Cloud Run was complex. This was resolved by meticulously applying the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary roles (e.g., Storage Object Viewer, Artifact Registry Writer, Cloud Run Developer) to specific service accounts.

    Secret Management in CI/CD: Securely passing GCP service account keys and other sensitive information to Jenkins and then into the Docker build process was critical. This was addressed by leveraging Jenkins' built-in credentials management and environment variables, ensuring secrets were never hardcoded or exposed in logs.

    Pipeline Orchestration & Error Handling: Ensuring smooth execution across various pipeline stages (data ingestion -> transformation -> training) and robust error handling was a significant task. This was achieved through careful structuring of the pipelines module, comprehensive try-except blocks, and detailed logging, allowing for quick identification and resolution of issues.

    Reproducibility Across Environments: Maintaining consistent environments from local development to Jenkins and Cloud Run was vital. Docker was instrumental here, packaging the application and its dependencies into a single, portable unit, guaranteeing consistent behavior.

    Debugging Cloud Deployments: Debugging issues on Google Cloud Run required understanding container logs and service health. Utilizing Cloud Logging and monitoring metrics helped pinpoint and resolve deployment failures.

🔮 Future Enhancements

    Model Monitoring: Implement dedicated services (e.g., using Prometheus/Grafana or GCP's Operations Suite) to monitor model performance in production, detect data drift, and trigger automated retraining.

    Automated Retraining: Set up scheduled jobs (e.g., using Cloud Scheduler + Cloud Functions/Cloud Run jobs) to periodically retrain the model with fresh data.

    A/B Testing: Introduce A/B testing capabilities for different model versions to evaluate their real-world impact.

    Scalability & Resilience: Explore using Kubernetes (GKE) for more complex orchestration and fine-grained control over deployment, scaling, and self-healing.

    Feature Store: Implement a feature store (e.g., Feast) to manage and serve features consistently for both training and inference.

    User Interface: Develop a more interactive web interface for users to input reservation details and get predictions, along with dashboards for monitoring.

This project demonstrates a strong foundation in MLOps, cloud engineering, and machine learning, showcasing the ability to build, deploy, and manage production-ready ML solutions. I am actively seeking opportunities to apply these skills and contribute to innovative teams.
