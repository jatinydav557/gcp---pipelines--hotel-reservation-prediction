# 🏨 Hotel Reservation Prediction: An End-to-End MLOps Pipeline

**Predicting Customer Reservation Cancellations with Automated ML Deployment**

This project demonstrates a robust, end-to-end MLOps pipeline for predicting whether a hotel customer will cancel their reservation. Leveraging a modular codebase, automated CI/CD, and cloud-native services, it showcases best practices in machine learning engineering and deployment.

## 🎯 Project Overview

In the competitive hospitality industry, predicting reservation cancellations is crucial for optimizing resource allocation and maximizing revenue. This project tackles this challenge by developing a machine learning model that predicts cancellation likelihood based on various booking features. More importantly, it establishes a complete MLOps workflow to ensure the model is continuously trained, validated, and deployed reliably and efficiently.

**Key Objectives:**
* **Build a predictive model:** Accurately forecast hotel reservation cancellations.
* **Automate the ML lifecycle:** Implement pipelines for data ingestion, transformation, model training, and deployment.
* **Ensure reproducibility:** Track experiments and manage model versions.
* **Achieve continuous delivery:** Deploy the model as a web service via CI/CD.
* **Secure operations:** Manage sensitive credentials and permissions effectively.

## ✨ Key MLOps Features & Practices

This project incorporates a wide array of MLOps principles and tools:

* **☁️ Data Ingestion from GCP Buckets:** Automated fetching of raw reservation data directly from Google Cloud Storage buckets, ensuring a scalable and reliable data source.
* **⚙️ Modular Project Structure:**
    * `src` Directory: Organized into `data_ingestion`, `transformation`, `model_training`, and `pipelines` for clear separation of concerns.
    * `config` Module: Centralized configuration management using a dedicated `config.py` for all parameters, paths, and settings, promoting maintainability and easy updates.
    * **OOP Concepts:** Extensive use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with classes for data handling, model training, and pipeline stages, enhancing code reusability, testability, and scalability.
    * **Exception Handling:** Robust error handling implemented across all pipeline stages to ensure graceful failure and provide clear debugging information.
    * `utils` Module: Collection of helper functions to support various tasks, from data loading to logging.
    * **Logging:** Detailed logging implemented throughout the pipeline for monitoring, debugging, and auditing.
* **📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Feature Engineering (FE):** Initial data exploration and feature engineering were performed in Jupyter Notebooks to gain insights and prepare data for model training.
* **🧪 Experiment Tracking with MLflow:**
    * MLflow is integrated to track all model training experiments, logging parameters, metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), and artifacts (trained models).
    * Enables easy comparison of different model runs and selection of the best-performing model.
* **🚀 Automated CI/CD with Jenkins & Google Cloud Run:**
    * **Jenkins:** Orchestrates the CI/CD pipeline, triggering builds, tests, and deployments upon code changes.
    * **Docker Containerization:** The Flask web application, serving the inference API, is containerized using Docker.
    * **Google Cloud Artifact Registry:** Docker images are built and pushed to Google Cloud Artifact Registry for secure and versioned storage.
    * **Google Cloud Run Deployment:** The containerized application is automatically deployed to Google Cloud Run, providing a fully managed, scalable, and serverless environment for the inference service.
* **🔒 Secure Credential Management:** Utilized secret keys and GCP service account keys with fine-grained permissions to securely access Google Cloud resources, ensuring best practices for sensitive information.
* **✅ Pipeline Testing & Validation:** Rigorous testing of all pipeline components (data ingestion, transformation, model training) to ensure correctness and reliability before deployment.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project's architecture is designed for automation, scalability, and reliability:

**Data Flow & Components:**
1.  **Data Source:** Raw hotel reservation data resides in Google Cloud Storage Buckets.
2.  **Code Repository:** The entire codebase is hosted on GitHub.
3.  **CI/CD Trigger:** Any push to the `main` branch on GitHub triggers a build job in Jenkins.
4.  **Jenkins Pipeline:**
    * Pulls the latest code from GitHub.
    * Executes the MLOps pipelines (`data_ingestion`, `transformation`, `model_training`).
    * Logs experiment details and artifacts to MLflow Tracking Server.
    * Builds a Docker image for the Flask inference application.
    * Pushes the Docker image to Google Cloud Artifact Registry.
    * Deploys the new image to Google Cloud Run.
5.  **Inference Service:** The deployed Flask application on Google Cloud Run serves predictions via a REST API.
6.  **Security:** GCP Service Accounts and secret keys manage access and permissions throughout the pipeline and deployment.

*(Consider adding a visual architecture diagram here for better understanding, e.g., a simple block diagram showing the flow from GCP Storage to GCP Cloud Run via Jenkins)*

## 🚧 Challenges & Solutions

Developing this end-to-end MLOps pipeline presented several interesting challenges, which were successfully overcome:

* **GCP Permissions & Service Accounts:** Initially, configuring the correct IAM roles and permissions for service accounts to interact with Cloud Storage, Artifact Registry, and Cloud Run was complex.
    * **Solution:** This was resolved by meticulously applying the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary roles (e.g., Storage Object Viewer, Artifact Registry Writer, Cloud Run Developer) to specific service accounts.
* **Secret Management in CI/CD:** Securely passing GCP service account keys and other sensitive information to Jenkins and then into the Docker build process was critical.
    * **Solution:** This was addressed by leveraging Jenkins' built-in credentials management and environment variables, ensuring secrets were never hardcoded or exposed in logs.
* **Pipeline Orchestration & Error Handling:** Ensuring smooth execution across various pipeline stages (data ingestion -> transformation -> training) and robust error handling was a significant task.
    * **Solution:** This was achieved through careful structuring of the `pipelines` module, comprehensive `try-except` blocks, and detailed logging, allowing for quick identification and resolution of issues.
* **Reproducibility Across Environments:** Maintaining consistent environments from local development to Jenkins and Cloud Run was vital.
    * **Solution:** Docker was instrumental here, packaging the application and its dependencies into a single, portable unit, guaranteeing consistent behavior.
* **Debugging Cloud Deployments:** Debugging issues on Google Cloud Run required understanding container logs and service health.
    * **Solution:** Utilizing Cloud Logging and monitoring metrics helped pinpoint and resolve deployment failures.
* **Small Typos - But with exception handling and a bit of chatgpt i overcame the errors and debugged the application.**

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* **Model Monitoring:** Implement dedicated services (e.g., using Prometheus/Grafana or GCP's Operations Suite) to monitor model performance in production, detect data drift, and trigger automated retraining.
* **Automated Retraining:** Set up scheduled jobs (e.g., using Cloud Scheduler + Cloud Functions/Cloud Run jobs) to periodically retrain the model with fresh data.
* **A/B Testing:** Introduce A/B testing capabilities for different model versions to evaluate their real-world impact.
* **Scalability & Resilience:** Explore using Kubernetes (GKE) for more complex orchestration and fine-grained control over deployment, scaling, and self-healing.
* **Feature Store:** Implement a feature store (e.g., Feast) to manage and serve features consistently for both training and inference.
* **User Interface:** Develop a more interactive web interface for users to input reservation details and get predictions, along with dashboards for monitoring.
